                <p>First off we don't compete we compliment.  We aim to provide you with a one stop assist for your pets.  We Love animals and this project started off as a way to make a difference to the world of thousands if not hundred thosands pets that are lost, neglected, tortured, abused etc in South Africa.  We know we can't report every lost dog or cat or help find every lost pet or report every abused pet but we can can use technology to help us.  That is what we are good at and that is the medium we decided on  for this project. In short, see us as a tool to help you help us looking out for them. (Confusing? Not really, if you replace them with our pets.)</p>
