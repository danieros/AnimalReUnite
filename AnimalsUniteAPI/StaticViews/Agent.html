        Pricing structure is very simple as essentially all services are free. We are animal lovers and really just trying to recover costs. This is more a passion than a business for us but the reality is that it does cost money to build, improve, host etc.
        So how does it work:
        <div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding: 15px 5px 5px 0; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;    border: 2px solid;    border-radius: 25px;">
            <ul class="ulspecial">
                <li>You can use any of the services and all we ask for is a once off R50 donation. (Completely voluntary)</li>
                <li>R10 of your donation will be paid to your selected animal shelter and you will receive proof of payment.</li>
                <li>You can register as many pets as you want linked to one email address and one location.</li>
                <li>We will soon be releasing a mobile app which will be free for anyone that made a donation.</li>
                <li>We have a wall of heroes to thank everyone that has donated. Go and ahev a look.</li>
                <li>We aim to become your pet's facebook where you can share ideas with like minded people, learn more about your pet and most important of all we will assist you to activate the community when your pet get's lost.</li>
