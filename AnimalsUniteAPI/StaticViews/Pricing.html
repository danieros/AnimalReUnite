        Pricing structure is very simple and as animal lovers we really just trying to recover costs. This is more a passion than a business for us but the reality is that it does cost money to build, improve, host etc.
        So how does it work:
        <ul>
            <li>Once of registration fee of R60</li>
            <li>R10 of your registration fee will be paid to your selected animal shelter and you will receive proof of payment</li>
            <li>You do not pay anything when registering but if haven't received your EFT transfer in 30 days from registration your account will be disabled</li>
            <li>You can register as many pets as you want linked to one email address and one location</li>
            <li>We will soon release mobile app which will be free for use</li>
        </ul>
