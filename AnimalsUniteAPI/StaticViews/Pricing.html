        Pricing

    <br />
    <div class="jumbotron">
        Pricing structure is very simple as essentially all services are free. We are animal lovers we really just trying to recover costs. This is more a passion than a business for us but the reality is that it does cost money to build, improve, host etc.
        So how does it work:
        <div style="background-color: white; color: black; padding: 15px 5px 5px 0;">
            <ul class="ulspecial">
                <li>You can use any of the services and all we ask for is a once off R50 donation. (Completely voluntary)</li>
                <li>R10 of your donation will be paid to your selected animal shelter and you will receive proof of payment.</li>
                <li>You can register as many pets as you want linked to one email address and one location.</li>
                <li>We will soon release be releasing a mobile app which will be free for anyone that made a donation.</li>
                <li>We have a wall of heroes to thank everyone that has donated. Go and ahev a look.</li>
            </ul>
